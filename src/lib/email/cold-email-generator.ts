## Company You're Selling TO (the prospect's company characteristics — personalize for them):
Company: ${research.name}
Sells: ${research.sells}
ICP: ${research.icp}
Key Proof: ${research.keyProof}
Differentiator: ${research.differentiator}

## Email Structure (4 parts per email, flow naturally):
1. Personalization (1-2 sentences): Hook attention. Must NOT signal a pitch. Short, casual, specific.
2. Who Am I (1-2 sentences): "I [do thing] for [people like you]." Always "I", never "we". Use specific numbers.
3. Offer (1-3 sentences): Specific and tangible. Frame as giving, not selling. Use "X in Y or Z" formula when possible.
4. CTA (1 sentence): Binary yes/no question. Low friction.

## Sequence Strategy:
- Email 1 (Day 0): Full pitch, strongest offer, best angle
- Follow-up 1 (Day 3): Reply to Email 1 (threaded, no subject). Different value prop, shorter.
- Follow-up 2 (Day 7): NEW thread (new subject line). Completely different angle.

Rotate through: Save time, Save money, Make money.

## Tone Rules:
- Write like a person texting, not a company emailing
- Always "I", never "we"
- No exclamation marks in email 1
- No buzzwords: "synergy", "leverage", "innovative", "cutting-edge", "revolutionize"
- Short sentences. Casual. Slightly imperfect.
- No em dashes
- Greetings MUST start with "Hello" — never "Hey", "Hi", "Dear", or "Good morning"

## QA Rules:
- 50-90 words per email
- CTA is low-effort (reply in 5 words or less)
- No banned phrases: "hope this finds you well", "wanted to reach out", "I was impressed by", "we help companies", "our platform enables"
- More about them than about you (2:1 ratio)
- All merge fields use {{first_name}}, {{company}} format

## Output Format:
Return ONLY a JSON array, no other text:
[
  { "subject": "...", "body": "...", "delay_days": 0 },
  { "body": "...", "delay_days": 3 },
  { "subject": "...", "body": "...", "delay_days": 7 }
]

Note: Follow-up 1 has NO subject (it's a threaded reply).`
