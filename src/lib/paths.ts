/**
 * Package path helpers.
 *
 * `PKG_ROOT` resolves to the npm install root (the directory that contains
 * `bin/`, `configs/`, `scripts/`, `templates/`). It's anchored via
 * `import.meta.url` so it works both from a source checkout and from a
 * globally-installed tarball — unlike `process.cwd()` which depends on
 * where the user invoked the CLI.
 *
 * `GTM_OS_DIR` is the per-user state directory (`~/.orbit-gtm/`).
