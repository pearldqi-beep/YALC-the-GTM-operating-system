# YALC GTM-OS — Setup Procedure

This is the long-form runbook for the `/setup` skill. Walk the user through every step, in order. Each numbered step is a single conversational beat — confirm with the user before moving on when the step asks for input or approval.

Hard rules across the whole flow:
- **Never print or echo API keys, tokens, or secrets.** When you read `~/.gtm-os/.env` for any reason, mask values (e.g. `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...redacted`). Never display raw key values back to the user. Never include them in any tool input either.
- **Never push to git.** This skill only runs local YALC commands.
- **Never assume command success.** Every CLI call below has an exit-code check — if it fails, stop and report the exact stderr to the user before continuing.
- **Use `--non-interactive` everywhere.** YALC will not prompt mid-flow. All values are passed as flags.

---

## Step 1 — Verify YALC is installed (and recent enough)

Run:
```bash
yalc-gtm --version 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT_INSTALLED"
```

Decision tree:
- Output is `NOT_INSTALLED` (or command is not found) → run `npm i -g yalc-gtm-os` (warn the user it may need `sudo` on system Node; if so, ask before re-running with sudo). Re-check version.
- Output is a version string `< 0.7.0` → run `npm i -g yalc-gtm-os@latest`. Re-check.
- Output is `0.7.0` or higher → continue.

Print the resolved version once: `YALC GTM-OS <version> ready.`

---

## Step 2 — Run scaffold + write template .env

Run:
```bash
yalc-gtm start --non-interactive
```

Exit code 0 expected. The command writes `~/.gtm-os/` (config, db, env template) and prints a banner. Do not parse the banner — just confirm exit 0.

When the template is written for the first time, the CLI auto-opens `~/.gtm-os/.env` in the user's default editor (TextEdit on macOS, the system default on Linux/Windows). The CLI also prints inline guidance: remove the leading `#`, paste the key value, save the file. **You do not need to repeat those instructions** — the CLI already showed them.

If the directory already existed, the command will preserve user-filled keys and only delta-merge new placeholder lines. The auto-open does NOT fire on a delta-merge (only on a fresh template). That's fine — proceed without warning the user.

For headless / CI contexts, pass `--no-open-env` to suppress the editor launch.

---

## Step 3 — Hand off the .env to the user

The CLI in Step 2 already opened the file in the user's editor and printed the inline guidance. Tell the user, verbatim or close to it:

> I just opened `~/.gtm-os/.env` in your default editor. Remove the leading `#` from the lines you want to enable, paste your API key after the `=` sign, and save the file. Tell me **"keys done"** when you have saved it.

If the user reports the auto-open did not fire (e.g. headless terminal, container, SSH session), tell them to open the file manually:

> Run `open ~/.gtm-os/.env` (macOS) or `xdg-open ~/.gtm-os/.env` (Linux) — or just open `~/.gtm-os/.env` in your editor of choice.

Wait for the user to confirm. Do not progress until they say "keys done".

While waiting, do not read the file's contents back into chat — the user does not need to see their own keys, and you must not display them under any circumstance.

---

## Step 4 — Collect capture inputs

Ask the user, one question at a time:

1. **Required** — "What is your company website URL?" (must start with `http://` or `https://`)
2. **Optional** — "Do you have a LinkedIn profile URL you'd like me to use for voice extraction? Skip if you'd rather not."
3. **Optional** — "Any docs you want me to ingest? Paste a URL or a local folder/file path. You can list more than one — I'll repeat the question if you have additional docs."

Do **not** ask for `--icp-summary` yet — only ask for it if Step 5 reports a thin fetch.

If the user can't or won't share a website, fall back to the legacy interactive interview by running `yalc-gtm start` (no `--non-interactive`) and let them answer the 10-question flow. Note this is rare; the website-driven path is the default.

---

## Step 5 — Run flag-driven capture

Construct the command from the inputs in Step 4:
```bash
yalc-gtm start --non-interactive \
  --website "<website>" \
  [--linkedin "<linkedin>"] \
  [--docs "<docs1>" --docs "<docs2>" ...]
```

Run it. Three outcomes:

**A — Exit 0 with a clean preview written.** Capture succeeded. Move to Step 6.

**B — Exit non-zero with `Insufficient source content` in stderr.** This is the synthesis-input-validation refusal (Phase 1 #3). Read the captured volumes from the message and ask the user for one of:
- A `--icp-summary "<one-liner>"` describing who they sell to, OR
- A different `--website` URL that has more content, OR
- An additional `--docs` source.

Re-run the command with the extra flag(s). Do **not** pass `--force-synthesis` unless the user explicitly says "ignore the bar and try anyway."

**C — Stdout contains a `<<<YALC_WEBFETCH_REQUEST:{...}>>>` marker.** YALC needs the parent harness (you) to fetch a URL it can't reach itself. Parse the JSON inside the marker — it has `url`, `save_to`, and `reason` fields. Then:

1. Use the WebFetch tool to fetch the URL.
2. Save the fetched markdown to the `save_to` path (create parent dirs if needed).
3. Re-run the same `yalc-gtm start` command. The cached content will now satisfy the fetch.

---

## Step 6 — Hand off to the SPA review surface

Capture finished by auto-opening `http://localhost:3847/setup/review` in the user's browser. The page lists every draft section as an editable card with a confidence badge — the user edits inline, saves per section, then clicks **Save & Commit** to promote everything to live.

Tell the user, verbatim or close to it:

> I've opened **http://localhost:3847/setup/review** in your browser. Edit each section as needed, hit **Save** on each card you change, then click **Save & Commit** to promote the preview to live. When you're done, tell me **"committed"** and I'll continue with doctor + framework recommendations.

Wait for the user to confirm "committed". Do not progress until they say so.

If the browser didn't open (headless box, CI, container) the CLI prints the URL — the user can copy it. If they have no browser at all, they can rerun with `--review-in-chat` for a terminal-driven walk that commits immediately:
```bash
yalc-gtm start --non-interactive --website "<website>" --review-in-chat
```

While waiting, do not read the preview files back into chat — the user is editing them in the browser and re-reading is just noise.

---

## Step 7 — Confirm commit

When the user says "committed", verify the sentinel:
```bash
test -f ~/.gtm-os/_handoffs/setup/review.committed && echo OK
```

The SPA's commit handler writes that file as soon as `/api/setup/commit` succeeds. If the file is missing the user may have closed the tab without clicking **Save & Commit** — gently ask them to revisit the page.

Confirm to the user: "Setup is now live at `~/.gtm-os/`. Running doctor next."

---

## Step 8 — Run doctor

Run:
```bash
yalc-gtm doctor
```

Read the output and summarize for the user:
- Total layers passed / warned / failed.
- Any **WARN** lines about missing keys or unfilled goals — pass these through.
- Any **FAIL** lines — flag them and ask the user if they want to fix now (likely a missing key) or continue.

Do not gate framework recommendation on doctor passing — many frameworks work with a subset of providers. But surface the failures clearly.

---

## Step 9 — Recommend frameworks

Run:
```bash
yalc-gtm framework:recommend
```

The command prints a ranked list of frameworks the user qualifies for, given the providers they configured and the company context they captured. Each row shows: name, one-line description, what it requires, where output will land (Notion if `NOTION_API_KEY` is set, dashboard otherwise).

For each recommended framework:
1. Read the description aloud (paraphrased).
2. Ask: "Want to install this one? (yes / skip)"
3. If yes — run the install wizard:
   ```bash
   yalc-gtm framework:install <name>
   ```
   The wizard prompts for inputs interactively. Walk the user through each prompt. When asked about output destination, default to `dashboard` if they don't have Notion configured.
4. After install, the seed run executes once. Print the output URL to the user.

If the user wants to install a recommended framework non-interactively (defaults are fine), use `--auto-confirm`:
```bash
yalc-gtm framework:install <name> --auto-confirm
```

Repeat for every framework the user accepts.

---

## Step 10 — Offer to lock an outbound hypothesis right now

This step is the antidote to the long-standing misroute where the founder asks
*"let's launch outbound campaign, what hypotheses can we test"* and the system
returns a content hook (the `propose-campaigns` content skill). The fix is
explicit: ask the user, then capture the 4 outbound dimensions BEFORE any
content is drafted. Do **not** auto-install — that hides intent.

### Step 10.1 — Channel-key gate

Before asking anything, check whether the user has at least one usable
outbound channel configured. Read `~/.gtm-os/.env` (silently — never print
keys back) and confirm one of:

- LinkedIn — both `UNIPILE_API_KEY` and `UNIPILE_DSN` are present and
  non-comment lines, OR
- Email — `INSTANTLY_API_KEY` is present and non-comment.

If neither is available, tell the user verbatim or close to it:

> Outbound campaigns need a channel. Set keys first via
> `yalc-gtm keys:connect` (LinkedIn = `UNIPILE_API_KEY` + `UNIPILE_DSN`,
> Email = `INSTANTLY_API_KEY`), then re-run `/setup`. Skipping this step.

Then jump straight to **Step 11**. Do not run `framework:install`.

### Step 10.2 — The single yes/skip prompt

If the channel-key gate passed, ask exactly:

> Want to test an outbound hypothesis right now? (yes / skip)

If the user says "skip", confirm "Skipping outbound hypothesis. You can run
`yalc-gtm framework:install outreach-campaign-builder` whenever you're
ready." and jump to Step 11. Do not install.

If the user says "yes", continue to Step 10.3.

### Step 10.3 — Install outreach-campaign-builder

Run:

```bash
yalc-gtm framework:install outreach-campaign-builder --auto-confirm --destination dashboard
```

Exit code 0 expected. The framework is `mode: on-demand`, so no launchd job
is written — the install only persists the installed-config sidecar that
the next sub-step writes the hypothesis into.

### Step 10.4 — Ask the 4 hypothesis questions, ONE AT A TIME, IN ORDER

Ask each question on its own conversational turn. Wait for the user's answer
before moving to the next. **Never** combine questions. **Never** ask about
content hooks, hook framings, or messaging variants — that happens later in
the framework, not here.

1. **ICP segment** — "Which ICP segment do you want to target? (Pick one
   from the segments captured at /setup — or describe a fresh one in a
   single line.)"

2. **Message angle** — "What's the one-line message angle you're testing?
   (The value prop you're asserting — not the hook, not the opener.)"

3. **Signal / trigger** — "What observable buying signal makes a prospect a
   fit for this hypothesis? (e.g. \"posted about SOC 2 in last 30 days\",
   \"hired a head of compliance this quarter\", \"raised Series A within
   the last 90 days\".)"

4. **Expected reply rate** — "What reply rate would make this hypothesis a
   win? (Express as a percentage — e.g. 5%. campaign-intelligence will
   score the campaign against this number.)"

Convert the percentage answer to a fraction in [0, 1] (e.g. 5% → 0.05) before
persisting.

### Step 10.5 — Persist the hypothesis

Persist the 4 captured fields by calling the shipped CLI helper that writes
both the JSON sidecar AND the installed-config slot:

```bash
yalc-gtm framework:set-hypothesis outreach-campaign-builder \
  --icp-segment "<answer 1>" \
  --message-angle "<answer 2>" \
  --signal-trigger "<answer 3>" \
  --expected-reply-rate <fraction>
```

Exit code 0 expected. Confirm to the user: "Hypothesis locked. Run
`yalc-gtm framework:run outreach-campaign-builder` whenever you're ready
to launch — the framework will draft variants, build the lead list, and
gate on you before sending anything."

### Step 10.6 — DO NOT proceed past hypothesis capture

The downstream framework steps (variants, lead search, sequence drafting,
verify-and-launch gate) are out of scope for setup. Stop here and continue
to Step 11.

---

## Step 11 — Propose + install the Routine

Up until now the user has clicked through providers, captured context, and
(optionally) locked an outbound hypothesis. The Routine Generator collapses
the remaining decisions ("which frameworks to install, on what schedule,
with which default dashboard") into a single yes/no prompt. The generator
is deterministic, rule-based, and reads only the artifacts already on disk
— no LLM, no network calls.

### Step 11.1 — Run the proposal (read-only)

Run:

```bash
yalc-gtm routine:propose
```

Exit code 0 expected when an Anthropic key is set. Exit code 2 means "no
reasoning provider" — the proposal still prints (it will be empty) but tell
the user to set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and skip directly to **Step 12**.

The output is a numbered list of frameworks (with schedule + rationale per
entry), the chosen default dashboard route, and any generator notes. The
command is read-only — it never writes to `~/.gtm-os/`.

### Step 11.2 — The single yes / show details / skip prompt

Show the user the proposed routine output verbatim, then ask exactly:

> Install this routine? (yes / show details / skip)

- **yes** — continue to Step 11.3.
- **show details** — for each framework in the proposal, print the
  framework yaml `description` plus the entry `rationale` (already on
  the proposal). Then re-ask the prompt.
- **skip** — confirm "Skipping routine install. You can re-run
  `yalc-gtm routine:propose` whenever you are ready." and jump straight
  to **Step 12**. Do not call `routine:install`. The proposal is *not*
  persisted on skip — re-running setup re-derives.

### Step 11.3 — Apply

Run:

```bash
yalc-gtm routine:install --yes
```

Exit code 0 expected. The command:

- Re-runs `routine:propose` internally (so a stale preview cannot drift).
- Calls `framework:install --auto-confirm --destination dashboard` per
  non-deferred entry.
- Skips frameworks already installed (idempotent — re-running is safe).
- Skips deferred entries (currently only `outreach-campaign-builder`
  without a locked hypothesis — Step 10 covers that path).
- Writes `~/.gtm-os/routine.yaml` (the proposal snapshot + install meta).
- Patches `dashboard.default_route` into `~/.gtm-os/config.yaml`.

Print the command stdout to the user — it lists what got installed,
skipped, and any warnings.

---

## Step 12 — Hand-off summary

Print a closing summary:

- **Installed providers:** read from `~/.gtm-os/config.yaml` (services with non-empty keys).
- **Active frameworks:** run `yalc-gtm framework:list` and report the ones with `status: active`.
- **Output destinations:** Notion parent page (if set) and `http://localhost:3847/frameworks` (dashboard).
- **What to check daily:** the dashboard URL or the Notion pages.
- **How to inspect a framework:** `yalc-gtm framework:status <name>` and `yalc-gtm framework:logs <name>`.
- **How to disable / remove:** `yalc-gtm framework:disable <name>` (keeps config) or `yalc-gtm framework:remove <name>` (deletes).

End with: "You're set. The frameworks will run on their own schedules. Come back anytime — `yalc-gtm framework:recommend` will surface new ones as you add providers or context."
