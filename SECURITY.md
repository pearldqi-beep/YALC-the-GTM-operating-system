## Security Design

Orbit GTM handles sensitive data (API keys, lead information, campaign data). Key security measures:

- **API key encryption:** Stored keys are encrypted with AES-256-GCM using the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var
- **Outbound validation:** Every human-facing message passes through `validateMessage()` before sending
- **Rate limiting:** DB-backed token bucket prevents abuse of external APIs
- **No secret logging:** API keys are never logged — masked as `sk-...redacted`
- **Local-first:** All data stored in local SQLite by default, nothing leaves your machine unless you configure external providers
