> AI plans your campaigns, qualifies your leads, and learns from every interaction.

Orbit GTM is an open-source, AI-native operating system for running any GTM campaign. CLI-first. Intelligence compounds from every interaction.

## Quick Start

Node.js 20 or higher required ([nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g orbit-gtm
orbit-gtm start
```

That is the whole installation. The `start` command writes its config to `~/.orbit-gtm/` and walks you through the rest.

Orbit GTM is a CLI; there's no public Node API to import.

### Updating

```bash
npm update -g orbit-gtm
```

### From source (contributors)

If you want to hack on Orbit GTM itself, clone the repo and link locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Othmane-Khadri/Orbit GTM-the-GTM-operating-system.git
cd Orbit GTM-the-GTM-operating-system
corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
pnpm install
pnpm link --global
```

If `pnpm link --global` fails with `ERR_PNPM_NO_GLOBAL_BIN_DIR` (or you are on Windows), run Orbit GTM in-repo with `pnpm cli start` instead.

The `start` command walks you through 4 steps:

1. **Environment** — Collects API keys. All keys are optional; setup never blocks on a missing one. Without `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` you can still complete onboarding — Steps 3–4 are skipped and can be finished later by running `orbit-gtm onboard` then `orbit-gtm configure`. When run inside Claude Code, both `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` default to skip (the parent CC session covers LLM + WebFetch).
2. **Company Context** — Interactive interview about your company, ICP, pain points, competitors, and voice. Optionally scrapes your website for additional context.
3. **Framework** *(skipped without an Anthropic key)* — Claude synthesizes everything into a structured GTM framework (segments, signals, positioning, competitors). You see a summary and confirm before anything is written to disk.
4. **Goals & Config** *(skipped without an Anthropic key)* — Claude recommends goals and generates qualification rules, outreach templates, and search queries.

You'll end with a readiness report showing what's unlocked and a suggested first command.

### Onboarding modes

When you run `orbit-gtm start`, you can choose how to provide context: answer questions one by one, paste a long-form response covering all questions at once, or hand over your website + documents and let Orbit GTM infer the positioning for you. Pick whichever matches the material you already have ready.

### After Setup

```bash
# Easiest: describe what you want in natural language and let Orbit GTM plan the work
orbit-gtm orchestrate "find 10 SaaS CTOs matching my ICP and qualify them"

# Create a campaign
orbit-gtm campaign:create --title "Q2 Outbound" --hypothesis "VP Eng responds to pain-point messaging"

# Track campaign progress
orbit-gtm campaign:track --dry-run

# Or qualify a lead list you already have (CSV or JSON)
orbit-gtm leads:qualify --source csv --input ./your-leads.csv --dry-run

# Send via a non-default email provider (e.g. Brevo via the MCP template)
orbit-gtm email:send --provider brevo --to lead@example.com --body "Hi there"
```

### Non-Interactive Setup

For CI or automation, set your keys in `~/.orbit-gtm/.env` (or `.env.local` in your project) and run:

```bash
orbit-gtm start --non-interactive
```

A minimal env file looks like:

```env
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
UNIPILE_API_KEY=...
UNIPILE_DSN=https://api{N}.unipile.com:{PORT}
NOTION_API_KEY=secret_...
ENCRYPTION_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

## Recommended workflow: drive Orbit GTM from your IDE chat

Orbit GTM is designed to be driven by an AI assistant — Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, or whatever you have open. Once it's installed globally, you don't need to remember commands. You just talk to your assistant.

Typical flow inside Cursor or VS Code with Claude Code:

1. Install once: `npm i -g orbit-gtm`.
2. Open your IDE and ask in plain language: *"Set up Orbit GTM for my company, then find 10 SaaS CTOs and qualify them."*
3. The assistant runs the commands. Interactive prompts from `start` show up in the same chat panel; you answer them inline.

Every command also works directly in a terminal if you prefer that style. The "Using Orbit GTM from Claude Code" section below has the details on how Claude Code integrates with Orbit GTM's commands and how the LLM hand-off works when no `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set.

## Using Orbit GTM from Claude Code (IDE or Terminal)

Orbit GTM works the same whether you run it from a coding IDE (VS Code, Cursor) or a standalone terminal. The CLI uses the same interactive prompts in both.

**IDE (VS Code / Cursor with Claude Code extension):**
You can ask Claude Code to run commands for you. For the initial setup, it's better to run `orbit-gtm start` yourself in the integrated terminal so you can answer the interactive prompts. After that, Claude Code can run any Orbit GTM command on your behalf — qualifying leads, creating campaigns, tracking results.

If your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is already in your environment (common in Claude Code sessions), the `start` command detects it automatically and skips the prompt.

**Terminal (standalone):**
Run commands directly. The interactive prompts work as expected in any terminal emulator.

### Running Orbit GTM inside Claude Code (no extra keys required)

When Orbit GTM detects a parent Claude Code session — via `CLAUDECODE`, `CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT`, or `CLAUDE_CODE_SSE_PORT` env vars set by Claude Code itself — both the **Anthropic** and **Firecrawl** keys become **optional**:

- The parent CC session already provides LLM reasoning, so a separate Anthropic API key isn't needed for ad-hoc planning, qualification, or personalization (just ask Claude Code).
- Claude Code's built-in `WebFetch` tool covers single-URL scrapes, so Firecrawl is only needed for JS-rendered pages, multi-page crawls, or web search.
- Claude Code's `WebSearch` is also honored when onboarding needs to discover a company URL — if you skip the website prompt, Orbit GTM asks the parent CC session to run a `WebSearch` for `"<company> official website"` instead of calling Firecrawl.

**What works in Claude Code mode with zero provider keys:**

| Command | Works? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `start` | ✓ | Steps 1–2 complete; Steps 3–4 (framework synth, goals) are skipped with a "come back after adding ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" message |
| `leads:import` | ✓ | Pure CSV/JSON ingest, no LLM |
| `campaign:create` (with `--title` + `--hypothesis`) | ✓ | LLM is only used for the optional auto-plan path |
| `campaign:track`, `campaign:schedule`, `campaign:report` (data-only) | ✓ | Pure CRUD against Notion / DB |
| `notion:sync`, `notion:bootstrap` | ✓ | |
| `email:send`, `email:status` | ✓ | Sends pre-written copy via Instantly |
| `orchestrate`, `leads:qualify`, `personalize`, `competitive-intel` | Redirect | Prints a message and exits cleanly without doing the work. Re-issue the request inside a Claude Code session so the parent LLM runs it, or add an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and run again standalone. |

**When you DO still want an Anthropic key:**

- Running Orbit GTM standalone (no parent CC session)
- Running Orbit GTM under cron, launchd, CI, or any unattended scheduler
- You want the qualifier / personalizer / orchestrator to run autonomously without you babysitting it from a CC chat

**Web-fetch provider override** — set `WEB_FETCH_PROVIDER` in `.env.local`:

- `auto` (default) — use Firecrawl if present, otherwise hand off to Claude Code's WebFetch
- `firecrawl` — force Firecrawl, error if no key
- `claude-code` — never call Firecrawl; commands that need a web fetch will emit a "fetch this URL with WebFetch and re-run with `--input <file>`" handoff

**File Structure — Where Things Live:**

```

When talking to Claude Code, reference these locations directly:
- "Update my qualification rules" → edits `~/.orbit-gtm/qualification_rules.md`
- "Add a segment to my framework" → edits `~/.orbit-gtm/framework.yaml`
- "Qualify leads from this CSV" → reads from `./data/leads/`

## Configuration

Orbit GTM uses `~/.orbit-gtm/config.yaml` for persistent configuration:

```yaml
notion:
  campaigns_ds: ""
  leads_ds: ""
  variants_ds: ""
  parent_page: ""
unipile:
  daily_connect_limit: 30
  sequence_timing:
    connect_to_dm1_days: 2
    dm1_to_dm2_days: 3
  rate_limit_ms: 3000
qualification:
  rules_path: ~/.orbit-gtm/qualification_rules.md
  exclusion_path: ~/.orbit-gtm/exclusion_list.md
  disqualifiers_path: ~/.orbit-gtm/company_disqualifiers.md
  cache_ttl_days: 30
crustdata:
  max_results_per_query: 50
fullenrich:
  poll_interval_ms: 2000
  poll_timeout_ms: 300000
memory:
  embeddings:
    provider: voyage   # voyage (default) | openai
```

### Env file precedence

Orbit GTM loads `~/.orbit-gtm/.env` automatically on every run (followed by `.env.local` in the current working directory as a fallback). Variables already present in your shell environment win — `~/.orbit-gtm/.env` only fills in keys that aren't already set. To stop using a provider, remove its line from `~/.orbit-gtm/.env` rather than `unset`-ing it in your terminal, since the file is reloaded on the next invocation.

## Key Design Decisions

- **Intelligence everywhere**: Every campaign outcome feeds the intelligence store. The system learns what works per segment/channel.
- **Outbound validation**: Every human-facing message passes through `validateMessage()`. Hard violations block sends.
- **Rate limiting**: DB-backed token bucket rate limiter on all external sends (LinkedIn connects, DMs, emails).
- **No silent mocks**: Provider registry throws `ProviderNotFoundError` with suggestions instead of silently falling back to mock data.
- **Transactions**: All campaign tracker DB writes are wrapped in Drizzle transactions.

## Contributing

1. Follow the three-layer pattern: Service → Provider → Skill
2. Run `pnpm typecheck` after every file change
3. Support `--dry-run` on any command that sends or writes
4. Never log API keys — use `sk-...redacted` pattern
5. Wire campaign outcomes to the intelligence store
