Score this lead against the provided ICP criteria.

**Lead:**
- Name: {{lead_name}}
- Title: {{lead_title}}
- Company: {{lead_company}}
- Additional context: {{additional_context}}

**ICP Criteria:**
{{icp_criteria}}

If `additional_context` is empty, score using only the lead/title/company/icp_criteria fields above. Do NOT ask follow-up questions and do NOT fabricate context — return a result with `intent_signals.score = 0` and `intent_signals.reason = "no additional context provided"` instead.

Evaluate each ICP dimension on a 0-100 scale:
1. **Title Fit** — Does their role match the target buyer persona?
2. **Company Fit** — Does the company match industry, size, and stage criteria?
3. **Seniority Fit** — Are they at the right decision-making level?
4. **Intent Signals** — Any buying signals in the additional context?

Return a JSON object:
```json
{
  "overall_score": 0,
  "verdict": "hot|warm|monitor|disqualified",
  "dimensions": {
    "title_fit": { "score": 0, "reason": "" },
    "company_fit": { "score": 0, "reason": "" },
    "seniority_fit": { "score": 0, "reason": "" },
    "intent_signals": { "score": 0, "reason": "" }
  },
  "recommended_action": "",
  "personalization_hooks": []
}
```

Scoring thresholds:
- 80-100: hot (immediate outreach)
- 50-79: warm (nurture sequence)
- 20-49: monitor (add to watchlist)
- 0-19: disqualified (skip)
