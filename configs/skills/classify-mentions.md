For each mention in `mentions`, decide:

1. **Relevance score (0-100)** — apply the rule: {{relevance_prompt}}
2. **Sentiment** — one of: positive, neutral, negative, mixed.
3. **One-line classification rationale** — why you scored it that way.

Return the same array, with each row enriched with new fields:
```json
{
  "...original fields": "",
  "relevance_score": 0,
  "sentiment": "neutral",
  "rationale": ""
}
```

Be strict — name-drops without context score below 30. Real evaluations / comparisons score 70+.
