## Bring your own email provider

Instantly is the default email backend, but Orbit GTM can route `email:send` through any provider that advertises the `email_send` capability via the MCP registry. Brevo, Mailgun, and SendGrid ship as templates out of the box.

Three steps to swap in a new provider:

1. **Copy the template** into `~/.orbit-gtm/mcp/` so it loads on the next CLI invocation:
   ```bash
   orbit-gtm provider:add --mcp brevo
   ```
   The command prints the env vars the template references and whether each is already set.
2. **Set the env var(s)** the template needs in `~/.orbit-gtm/.env` (or your shell):
   ```bash
   echo "BREVO_API_KEY=xkeysib-..." >> ~/.orbit-gtm/.env
   ```
3. **Verify connectivity** with the provider health check:
   ```bash
   orbit-gtm provider:test brevo
   ```
   On success, `provider:list` shows the provider as `OK` and you can route a send through it with `email:send --provider brevo`. To make it the default for all sends, set `email.provider: brevo` in `~/.orbit-gtm/config.yaml`.

The same recipe works for `mailgun` and `sendgrid` — only the env var names change. To stop using a provider, run `orbit-gtm provider:remove <name>`.

## Checking Your Setup

Run the doctor command anytime to verify all providers:

```bash
orbit-gtm doctor
```

This runs a 5-layer diagnostic:
1. **Environment** — checks all env vars are present and formatted correctly
2. **Database** — verifies SQLite/Postgres connection and schema
3. **Providers** — makes live API calls to test each configured provider
4. **Context** — checks memory store and tenant configuration
5. **Framework** — verifies your GTM framework is derived and complete

## Adding Keys Later

You can always add new provider keys after initial setup:

1. Add the key to `.env.local`
2. Run `orbit-gtm doctor` to verify
3. The new capabilities are immediately available
